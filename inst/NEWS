gtools 3.4.3 - 2015-04-06
-------------------------

Enhancements:

- The 'q' argument to quantcut() now accept an integer
  indicating the number of equally spaced quantile groups to
  create. (Suggestion and patch submitted by Ryan C. Thompson.)

Bug fixes:

- Removed stray browser() call in smartbind().

Other changes:

- Correct typographical errors in package description.


gtools 3.4.2 - 2015-04-06
-------------------------

New features:

- New function loadedPackages() to display name, version, and path of
  loaded packages (package namespaces).

- New function: na.replace() to replace missing values within a
  vector with a specified value.`

Bug fixes:

- Modify keywords() to work properly in R 3.4.X and later.


gtools 3.4.1 - 2014-05-27
-------------------------

Bug fixes:

- smartbind() now converts all non-atomic type columns (except factor)
  to type character instead of generating an opaque error message.

Other changes:

- the argument to ASCIIfy() is now named 'x' instead of 'string'.

- minor formatting changes to ASCIIfy() man page.

gtools 3.4.0 - 2014-04-14
-------------------------

New features:

- New ASCIIfy() function to converts character vectors to ASCII
  representation by escaping them as \x00 or \u0000 codes.
  Contributed by Arni Magnusson.


gtools 3.3.1 - 2014-03-01
-------------------------

Bug fixes:

- 'mixedorder' (and hence 'mixedsort') not properly handling
  single-character strings between numbers, so that '1a2' was being
  handled as a single string rather than being properly handled as
  c('1', 'a', '2').



gtools 3.3.0 - 2014-02-11
-------------------------

New features:

- Add the getDependencies() function to return a list of dependencies
  for the specified package(s).  Includes arguments to control whether
  these dependencies should be constructed using information from
  locally installed packages ('installed', default is TRUE), avilable
  CRAN packages ('available', default is TRUE) and whether to include
  base ('base', default=FALSE) and recommended ('recommended', default
  is FALSE) packages.

Bug fixes:

- binsearch() was returning the wrong endpoint & value when the found
  value was at the upper endpoint.

gtools 3.2.1 - 2014-01-13
-------------------------

Bug fixes:

- Resolve circular dependency with gdata


gtools 3.2.0 - 2014-01-11
-------------------------

New features:

- The keywords() function now accepts a function or function name as
  an argument and will return the list of keywords associated with the
  named function.

- New function stars.pval() which will generate p-value significance
  symbols ('***', '**', etc.)

Bug fixes:

- R/mixedsort.R: mixedorder() was failing to correctly handle numbers
  including decimals due to a faulty regular expression.

Other changes:

- capture() and sprint() are now defunct.


gtools 3.1.1 - 2013-11-06
-------------------------

Bug fixes:

- Fix problem with mixedorder/mixedsort when there is zero or one
  elements in the argument vector.


gtools 3.1.0 - 2013-09-22
-------------------------

Major changes:

- The function 'addLast()' (deprecated since gtools 3.0.0) is no
  longer available, and has been marked defunct.

Bug fixes:

- Modified 'mixedorder()' to use Use 'suppressWarnings() instead of
  'options(warn=-1)'.  This will avoid egregious warning messages when
  called from within a nested environment, such as when run from
  within 'knitr'


gtools 3.0.0 - 2013-07-06
-------------------------

Major changes:

- The function 'addLast()' has been deprecated because it directly
  manipulates the global environment, which is expressly prohibited by
  the CRAN policies.

- A new function, 'lastAdd()' has been created to replace 'addLast()'.
  The name has been changed because the two functions require
  different syntax. 'addLast()' was used like this:

    byeWorld <- function() cat("\nGoodbye World!\n")
    addLast(byeWorld)

  The new 'lastAdd()' function is used like this:

    byeWorld <- function() cat("\nGoodbye World!\n")
    .Last <- lastAdd(byeWorld)

Bug fixes:

- Update checkRVersion() to work with R version 3.0.0 and later.

Other changes:

- Remove cross-reference to (obsolete?) moc package

- The function 'assert()' (deprecated since gtools 2.5.0) is no longer
  available and has been marked defunct.

gtools 2.7.1 - 2013-03-17
-------------------------

Bug fixes:

- smartbind() was not properly handling factor columns when the first
  data frame did not include the relevant column.

gtools 2.7.0 - 2012-06-19
-------------------------

New features:

- smartbind() has a new 'sep' argument to allow specification of the
  character(s) used to separate components of constructed column names

- smartbind() has a new 'verbose' argument to provide details on how
  coluumns are being processed

Bug fixes:

- smartbind() has been enhanced to improve handling of factor and
  ordered factor columns.

-------------------------

New features:

- Add 'fill' argument to smartbind() to specify a value to use for
  missing entries.

 - src/setTCPNoDelay.c: Add C source code for setTCPNoDelay.

gtools 2.1.0
------------
